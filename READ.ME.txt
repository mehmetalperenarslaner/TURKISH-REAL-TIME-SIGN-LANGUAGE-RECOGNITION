The libraries can be downloaded by writing the names above with pip install library_name, or they can be downloaded by writing
pip install -r requirements.txt
in the command window (cmd) of conda or jupyter notebook using the created requirements.txt file.


After the libraries are loaded

10-TRTSLR.ipynb 
The files should be placed in the directory where the jupyter notebook is connected.

Then, the 10-TRTSLR.ipynb file should be run in order from the beginning.

Once these steps have been completed, the code can be started by pressing the "start" button in the upper left corner of the user interface that opens.
This method has been tested on three different computers and has worked successfully.
